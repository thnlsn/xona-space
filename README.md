<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

A freelance project I took up to redesign and rebuild the Xona Space Systems website. In addition to building the entire site from scratch with React/Sass, I also made it easier to maintain by having all static data populating from a single file for the client to easily update in the future. All components are custom made and scalable to as much data as neccesary. As for read-only backend data such as the job postings and news articles, I utilized the Google Sheets API which was a suggestion I offered in order to keep their in-house workflow for adding/removing job postings as unaltered, simple, and cheap as possible.
